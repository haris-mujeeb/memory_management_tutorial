# Memory Management Tutorial

This project is a C/C++ memory management tutorial, demonstrating basic memory allocation and deallocation concepts. It uses CMake for build system generation and includes Google Test for unit testing. The project is configured for development with VS Code, providing tasks for building and debugging.

## Build System

The project uses CMake to manage the build process and a `Makefile` for common development tasks.

### `CMakeLists.txt`

-   **Minimum Version**: Requires CMake 3.10 or higher.
-   **Project Name**: `MemoryManagementTutorial`.
-   **External Dependencies**: Uses `FetchContent` to download and integrate Google Test (release-1.11.0) directly into the build.
-   **Executable**: Creates an executable named `memory_management_tutorial` from `src/main.cpp` and `src/exercise.c`.
-   **Include Directories**: Adds the `include/` directory to the include paths.
-   **Link Libraries**: Links against `gtest_main` for Google Test integration.

### `Makefile`

The `Makefile` provides convenient commands for building, running, and debugging the project.

-   **`all`**: Configures and builds the project using CMake. This is the default target.
-   **`run`**: Builds the project (if not already built) and then executes the `memory_management_tutorial` executable.
-   **`debug`**: Configures and builds the project with debug symbols (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`) using CMake. This target is designed to be used with an external debugger (like the VS Code integrated debugger).
-   **`clean`**: Removes the `build` directory, effectively cleaning all compiled artifacts.

## VS Code Setup

The `.vscode` directory contains configurations to enhance the development experience within Visual Studio Code.

### `launch.json`

-   **`C++ Debug (gdb)`**: This launch configuration is set up for debugging the C++ project using `gdb`.
    -   **`program`**: Specifies the executable to debug: `${workspaceFolder}/build/memory_management_tutorial`.
    -   **`preLaunchTask`**: Runs the `Debug C++ project` task (defined in `tasks.json`) before launching the debugger. This ensures the project is built with debug symbols.
    -   **`MIMode`**: Set to `gdb`.
    -   **`miDebuggerPath`**: Points to the `gdb` executable (e.g., `/usr/bin/gdb`).
    -   **`setupCommands`**: Enables pretty-printing for `gdb`.

### `tasks.json`

-   **`Build C++ project`**: A shell task that runs `make` to build the project. This is the default build task.
-   **`Build & run C++ project`**: A shell task that runs `make run` to build and execute the project.
-   **`Debug C++ project`**: A shell task that runs `make debug`. This task is used by the `launch.json` configuration to build the project with debug symbols before debugging. It also includes a problem matcher for `gcc` output.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd memory_management_tutorial
    ```
2.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    make all
    ```
    Or, to build with debug symbols:
    ```bash
    make debug
    ```
3.  **Run the executable**:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
4.  **Debug in VS Code**:
    -   Open the project in VS Code.
    -   Go to the "Run and Debug" view (Ctrl+Shift+D).
    -   Select the "C++ Debug (gdb)" configuration.
    -   Click the green play button to start debugging. This will automatically build the project in debug mode and launch the debugger.
